ERROR stack
	can be removed https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/errors/
SingUp account created is always a User
#MAKE seperate module for validation throwing errors is not good




functions:
	sign token 2, correct pass, 

login X
SignUp username can be made better , validations are done  X
editUSER X
deleteUSer is deleteing record from db its should be changing status X
forgotPassword X
all fucntionality X
ARE GQL Validation enough on getAll USer



------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT USER validation not working fixed input update problem  X
validation===== try in prisma
	only email validation is applied using validator
	tolower,unique,check if valid email.

problem with output of login if user dont exsists error handling
findFirst in restPassword instead of unique
confirm password is removed
i am not encrypting password in sign up    X done

login create user is messing up

updating pass by using email, but i need it to move to ID

edit user vs edit pass checkout resetPass
REmove mongoose
correct password logic is fucked up in login
	--------------------
getUserByid          why to use and where to get the ID?
getUserByemail
chage types



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

create a random key that will be provided on auth header so that no onecan create multiple request like ddos.
if the key is present let the request be processed else reject the req

1 refactor
2 datasources with rest
3 auth

signToken is pasted	
double await from delete and edit removed so i nned to test it again
